# GeraltOfBIFFia
A (very simple) archive browser for the BIF (Bioware Indexed) files used to store assets for The Witcher 1.
BIF files store most of the the stuff (audio, textures, conversation files, compiled scripts) you'd typically find in a Bioware engine game (NW/KOTOR etc.)

* Windows GUI, requires .NET 2.0
* After opening a KEY file and expanding a BIF in the tree, double click on a resource to extract it.
